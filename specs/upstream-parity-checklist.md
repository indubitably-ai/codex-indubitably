## Batch Validation

- [x] CLI default provider smoke
- [x] CLI `--indubitably` smoke
- [x] Targeted crate tests for touched code
- [ ] App-server protocol smoke (if app-server/protocol files changed)

## Follow-ups

- Blocked commits: none in this 10-commit batch.
- Manual port TODOs: none; two commits used cherry-pick+surgical strategy.
- Risk notes: full `cargo test -p codex-core` currently fails in this environment due js_repl runtime requirement (Node >= 22.22.0; local is v20.19.5); targeted tests and CLI smokes passed.
